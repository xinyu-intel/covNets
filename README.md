# Description

The repo contains some r scripts aiming to build a demo covNets framework for image recognizing from scratch. 

**Attention** A brand new cnn framework can be found in the [Conv3d folder](https://github.com/xinyulab/covNets/tree/master/Conv3d)

## Old File Description

**cnn.R** run model on mnist dataset.

**convolution.R** convolution function.

**meanpool.R** mean pooling function.

**mnist.R** download and read mnist dataset automatically(download into data folder and save as .RData file).

**model.R** cnn model, forward and backward.

**predict.R** cnn predict function.

**relu.R** relu activation function.

**rotate.R** rotate matrix.

**python** a cnn python script based mainly on numpy.

**data** mnist data created by mnist.R.
